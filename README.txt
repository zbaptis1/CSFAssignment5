## MILESTONE WORK
*MS1: Need to complete the following*

- Connection h/cpp --> ! Priority !
- Receiver h/cpp
- Sender h/cpp


LOCAL CHANGES 
*MS2: Need to complete the following
  - Server h/cpp
  - Room h/cpp
  - User h/cpp
  - MessageQueue.h/cpp

##Contributions:

Yisehak:
*MS1
- Focused on receiver functionality
- Dealt with connection::receive() and receiver() logic and
  how it responds to sender
- Added additional client_util functions
- Created google doc to document thinking & progress
*MS2
- Implementing server functionality 
- Working on message queue sections
- 



Zyan:
*MS1
- Focused on sender functionality
- Focused on message utilization 
- Dealt with connection::send() and sender() logic and
  how it interacts with receiver
- In charge of most gradescope submissions
*MS2
- ADD CONTRIBUTIONS

Both:
- Worked on connection, basic functions to complex ones 
- Utilized debugger to fix logic errors 
- Utilized valgrind to fix mem. issues
- Worked on message functionality (especially split_payload())
- Went to countless TA OH hours and worked diligently
- Worked collaboratively and followed guidelines of prompt

##Report
*Implementation Report: Thread Synchronization 

::KEEP IN MIND::
*Since synchronization is an important part of this assignment, weâ€™d like you to 
support a report on your synchronization in your README.txt. Please include:
  - where your critical sections are
  - how you determined them, and why you chose the synchronization 
    primitives for each section. 
  - Also explain how your critical sections ensure that 
    the synchronization requires are met without introducing synchronization hazards 
    (e.g. race conditions and deadlocks).
