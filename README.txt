*Eventually your report about how you implemented thread synchronization
in the server should go here

*MS1: Need to complete the following*
- Message h/cpp
- Connection h/cpp --> ! Priority !
- Receiver h/cpp
- Sender h/cpp


##Contributions:

Yisehak:
- Focused on receiver functionality
- Dealt with connection::receive() and receiver() logic and
  how it responds to sender
- Added additional client_util functions
- Created google doc to document thinking & progress


Zyan:
- Focused on sender functionality
- Focused on message utilization 
- Dealt with connection::send() and sender() logic and
  how it interacts with receiver
- In charge of most gradescope submissions

Both:
- Worked on connection, basic functions to complex ones 
- Utilized debugger to fix logic errors 
- Utilized valgrind to fix mem. issues
- Worked on message functionality (especially split_payload())
- Went to countless TA OH hours and worked diligently
- Worked collaboratively and followed guidelines of prompt


*MS2: Need to complete the following
